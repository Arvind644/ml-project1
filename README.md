# water quality prediction project

We are making a water qualti prediction model which tell the quality of water

## Problem description

In this project, we are predicting quality of water as it is suitable to drink or not. The model take variables and predict whether it is safe or note


## file structure

notebook.ipynb - main jupyter noetbook
model.py - contain extract and main model from jupyter noetbook.  <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
predict.py - it perdict th eresult. <br /> <br /> <br />
predict-test.py - contain sample data <br /> <br />
model_C.bin - it saveds the model. <br />
Dockerfile - to riun the application in docker image
